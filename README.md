Abstract
In response to the global impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, we present a critical Face Mask Detection project aimed at developing an algorithm capable of accurately predicting mask-wearing behavior in images.  The requirement for a reliable system to recognize people wearing masks, not wearing them, or wearing them incorrectly in various real-world situations is highlighted by how crucial it is to stop the virus from spreading. To achieve the best performance, we conducted a thorough comparison of various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, evaluating their accuracy and efficiency . The successful implementation and deployment of this algorithm in public spaces and crowded areas can contribute significantly to public health measures, enabling real-time monitoring and effective control of infectious disease transmission.
